Tue Apr 08 2025: @hnshah theres so much competition in this space too wonder how it will play out
Tue Apr 08 2025: To be fair, OpenAI has pointed out to me that they do support generic completion uploads (as long as they follow the openai format). but I am generally skeptical of building inside a platform that favors their own patterns when sooo many alternatives exist. Anyway try it yourself
Tue Apr 08 2025: @defjosiah OK I'll admit that I may have overreacted a bit without fully researching. But I will say that I'd generally prefer a generic solution that doesnt explicitly favor openai patterns. Thanks for pointing this out, and I am excited to try it for myself, but I am skeptical

Tue Apr 08 2025: I'm a huge fan of OpenAI, but this is bad. Evals that lock you into a single LLM provider defeat the entire purpose of an evaluation platform. In a world where LLM benchmarks and leaderboards are being gamed and increasingly meaningless, running your own evals (across models) on

Sun Feb 23 2025: This take is so bad. I built a viral chat app that scaled to thousands of users and broke EVERY rule Alex claims is required for a "well-designed" application. &gt;No, you don't need RabbitMQ &gt;No, you don't need microservices &gt;No, you don't need to design for OpenAI rate limits
