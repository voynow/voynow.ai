article = """Chat Apps > MCP, Agents, Etc
If you spend enough time on Twitter, you might think that "RAG is dead" or that "chat apps are cringe" and that agentic systems, model context protocol MCP, and other bleeding-edge ideas are the only things that matter. The reality is that Chat applications still make up 95% of successful production LLM projects. And while long term I am bullish on agents, my job is to create value today.
This article is my raw, unfiltered playbook on how I build and scale chat apps fast by minimizing complexity, and getting real products into the hands of users ASAP.
Why You Should Believe Me
You probably know me as the Chat with the JFK Files guy. The day those files dropped, I built and shipped the app from 0 to 1 in just 4 hours. It took off fast: racking up 1M+ views on Twitter, tens of thousands of users, and just last week alone, it processed 83,000+ user events.
Google Analytics from this week
What most people don't know is that I've been building chat apps like this for years - it took years of preparation to be able to ship an effective chat app in an afternoon. By now, I've fine-tuned a brutally simple, radically anti-complex strategy that gets the job done. Some of it may go against intuition, but it works - serving thousands of users this week alone.
Basic Requirements
This is the quick and dirty way to build a chat app. And thats for the best. Odds are, your app won't be handling enterprise-scale traffic right away, so the goal is to write the least amount of code necessary to get a working product in front of users.
At minimum you will need the following
OCR: If needed, convert documents into text
Chunking: Converting text into bite-sized LLM-consumable pieces
Embeddings: Converting chunks into vectors
Vector DB: System for storing and retrieving embeddings/chunks
Language Model: LLM for answering Qs based on retrieved chunks
Frontend/Backend/Infra: The apps and compute required to get the job done
That's it. There are plenty of other optimizations that you could spend days or weeks on, but imo this is all you need to ship.
Don't Think, Just Ship
I feel very strongly that building fast and dirty is far more important than obsessing over details early on. No one cares about how good your ideas are if they never see the light of day. You won't build a following by talking about building - rather then tell people that you are legit, show them (by shipping). The same goes for stakeholders and customers: no one will praise you until they can actually use what you've built. So stop thinking and build that demo.
Critics will argue that once you find PMF and scale, you've f*cked yourself with bad architecture and tech debt; My counter: I'd rather deal with the consequences of suboptimal architecture then never ship at all.
OCR (If Applicable)
OK you have the documents, but what about converting them to useable text? OCR is the go-to solution, and frankly I don't have strong opinions on how you do it.
If your workload is small (<1k files), you could just rip it locally. I used pytesseract locally simply because I had some code laying around.
If your workload is large, if you want convenience, if you have cash to burn: use a cloud OCR service (Azure OCR, https://chunkr.ai/, etc)
Slight tangent: Gemini is basically SOTA in OCR in terms of both cost and accuracy (https://www.sergey.fyi/articles/gemini-flash-2). As LLMs improve, I expect this gap to widen where Gemini and co become the standard for fast, cheap, accurate OCR. I have yet to test this personally, but its worth exploring.
Chunking
One of my favorite topics! Here's a quick story to illustrate my opinion.
A coworker once dumped a failing project on me. The app barely worked: it was too expensive and way too slow. The problem? An over-engineered chunking strategy (using a sentence-level LLM classifier with max voting). Being me, I decided to do something quite radical to test my intuition. I threw out the old chunker and replaced it with dumb_fast_chunker, which split on newline characters and merged small chunks. No fancy classifiers, no extra steps. And to everyones surprise, our evals didn't budge. To this day dumb_fast_chunker is used in production 1000s of times per year.
The takeaway? Over-optimizing on chinking early on is a waste of time. Do the simple thing, build evals, and be data driven about further optimization.
Embeddings/Vector Database
Do whatever you gotta do to make your vector operations fast. Contrary to popular belief, at small-medium scale you can do this entirely in memory.
Generate embeddings: Just use OpenAI and don't question it (more on this later)
Store your embeddings: Create a Polars DF containing embeddings, chunks, metadata and use polars.DataFrame.write_parquet to create your “DB”
Retrieve embeddings: Read parquet file (possibly using functools.lru_cache) and use Numpy to calculate cosine similarity
Yes, the minimal approach is radical, but its unbelievably fast and simple for most workloads. Believe it or not, this is exactly how the first release of ChatWithJFKFiles was designed.
Okay okay - this does come with a huge caveat: for large workloads, you'll need a real vector DB to offload memory and compute from your server. Here I would recommend using Pinecone or equivalent, I've had no problems using Pinecone free tier.
Language Models
You need an LLM, but don't overthink this.
Benchmarks and performance metrics don't matter if the model fails under production workloads. Nothing beats OpenAI models in terms of performance and reliability - especially under workloads of high concurrency.
Rate limits are often cited as an issue, but OpenAI scales usage limits for its paying customers. For instance, my GPT-4o limit is currently sitting at 50M tokens per minute. If I ever hit that kind of load, we've got bigger problems (time to raise seed round).
Frontend, Backend, Infra
This is mostly personal preference - except for python, which is objectively the best language for AI development.
Frontend: I use Next.js + Vercel because it abstracts away the annoying and non differentiated parts of development (CICD, hosting, logging, etc). Sorry Vercel haters please forgive me.
Backend: Fast API & Digital Ocean App Platform > AWS. DO is cheaper, simpler, and again has built in CICD which is massive. In the event that your product goes viral, DO App Platform makes scaling very easy (more on this later).
These are the tools I use, but feel free to use what lets you ship the fastest.
Operating at Scale
This architecture actually scales well - but of course simplicity comes at a cost.
Your backend won't be able to handle major load on a single node. The fix? If you are using digital ocean, you can easily scale up the number of containers you are running.
Yes, it'll get expensive in the short term. But if your app is going viral, you only need to stomach the costs for a day or two. If traffic stays high, congrats - you have a real product. Monetize ASAP. Hire engineers. Maybe raise VC.
Stop worrying about costs. Building credibility is more valuable than a $20 bill from OpenAI + a $20 bill from digital ocean.
What Now
I'm not sure if I'll keep launching new released of JFK files or similar projects. While I am bullish on chat apps, something tells me its time to take on bigger challenges.
That said, ChatWithJFKFiles isn't going anywhere, and I will continue sharing what I've learned. If you want to chat, HMU! I can't promise that I will have time for everyone, but I'm always looking to connect with like-minded people.
And yeah, at the risk of sounding cringe, I am open to business opportunities. Need help building a chat app for your business? lets talk"""
